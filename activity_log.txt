Process flowchart:
input 
> pick expansion 
> get class list / get role list (reference expacData)
> get required roles (rolecheck)
> pick random role 
> pick random class 
> pick required spec 
> output

process 2

>construct list of expansions with filter
>build match list from available expansions
>input expansion string
>check match critera for expansion string against expansion list matches
>output chosen expansion to var

to update all speclist files to conform to specListWrath standard for integration, continue with test.py

20221114 am
current updat now in test.py

20221111 am
process 2 workflow update

20221110 am
update other specList to match specListWrath for integration into test.py code
pre import code found in scratchpad line 220

20221104 am
read matchlist for each expansion, rewrite user input to correct lowercase filename line 43 in test.py

20221103 am
integrate expacData into single module
research on how to filter expansion module names, check if expansion is valid, import expacData if true

20221102 am
functional pullSpec in scratchpad working with specListWrath, specListWrath modified: added class, __init__ with import, return, rename methods.

20221031 am
import python module using importlib

20221027 pm
evaluate concatenated string with eval(var), proof of concept in scratchpad

20221027 am
return of chosen class to pick spec from class in scratchpad

combine expacData and speclist data into one file

20220121 pm
functional expacData import from external source in scratchpad
functional return spec from provided role in scratchpad

20221021 am
functional expacData import in scratchpad


20221020
- functional return value from another file in test.py
    import file as f, get return value from function by using  variable =  f.[classname].[methodname]()
learning to read from return command from different file

20221018
test.py as working example of dynamic file import

20221017
end of expac_selection casting to variables
see line 24 expac_selection

internal variables > rolewt, cnt_tank, cnt_healer, cnt_melee, cnt_ranged, 
20220907 - added expac name to expacData, use that to import correct specList.

read generated variable from another python file
